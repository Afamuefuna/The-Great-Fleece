# The-Great-Fleece
Point and click game

In this game, i created four visually pleasing cutscenes for my game, The Great Fleece. Join Darren, our thief, in this stealth adventure game as he silently descends a black rope and lands in the Beatrice Auction House. with panoramic views of the auction houseâ€™s treasures: glittering jewels, marble, and fine artwork. Using voiceover and suspenseful music to allow the player a quick glance at the security cameras, patrolling guards, and the main vault. Pull the player into your story and artfully explain your game objective.

The most important takeaway from this project is

CINEMATOGRAPHY WITH UNITY
